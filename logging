System logs
System logs deal with exactly that - the Ubuntu system - as opposed to extra applications added by the user. These logs may contain information about authorizations, system daemons and system messages.

Authorization log
Location: /var/log/auth.log

Keeps track of authorization systems, such as password prompts, the sudo command and remote logins.

Daemon Log
Location: /var/log/daemon.log

Daemons are programs that run in the background, usually without user interaction. For example, display server, SSH sessions, printing services, bluetooth, and more.

Debug log
Location: /var/log/debug

Provides debugging information from the Ubuntu system and applications.

Kernel log
Location: /var/log/kern.log

Logs from the Linux kernel.

System log
Location: /var/log/syslog

Contains more information about your system. If you can’t find anything in the other logs, it’s probably here.


#enable logging 
sudo service rsyslog restart
