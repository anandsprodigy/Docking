#Bash does not have a type system, it can only save string values. Hence internally, Bash saves them as a string.

#In bash, * is a special character that represents a wildcard. When passed as an argument to a command, * contains all the files in the current directory as a list. 

#Bash script example

message="hello wold *";
echo $message;
echo "$message"

here in above case $message without quotes will show all files in current directory. When wild crard used in quotes, it will be taken as literal.
