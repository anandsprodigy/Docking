 #Convenient way to check if system is using systemd or sysvinit in BASH? 
 --> check ps aux and pid 1 will show the process.
 
 the init (initialization) process is the first process executed by the kernel at boot time. It has a process ID (PID) of 1, 
 it is executed in the background until the system is shut down.
 The init process starts all other processes, that is daemons, services and other background processes, 
 therefore, it is the mother of all other processes on the system.
 A process can start many other child processes on the system, but in the event that a parent process dies, 
 init becomes the parent of the orphan process.
 
 
 The need to replace init with something more perfect was felt from a long time and several alternatives were developed from time-to-time, some of which became distribution’s native init replacement, some of which are:

Upstart – A init replacement daemon implemented in Ubuntu GNU/Linux and designed to start process asynchronously.
Epoch – A init replacement daemon built around simplicity and service management, designed to start process single-threaded.
Mudar – A init replacement daemon written in Python, implemented on Pardus GNU/Linux and designed to start process asynchronously.
systemd – A init replacement daemon designed to start process in parallel, implemented in a number of standard distribution – Fedora, OpenSuSE, Arch, RHEL, CentOS, etc.

#linux epoch time
The Unix epoch (or Unix time or POSIX time or Unix timestamp) is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970

#.bash_profile is executed for login shells, while .bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells.

Profile and bash_logout are execuated on login. bashrc executed when user opens terminal.

# The SKEL variable specifies the directory containing "skeletal" user
# files; in other words, files such as a sample .profile that will be
# copied to the new user's home directory when it is created.
# SKEL=/etc/skel

When you want to create any files/folders into user directory then copy files in /etc/skel

 ~/.profile

#Since there are many versions of Unix, it creates incomaptibility between them, to standardize Unix OS, IEEE created POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)

Not all linux follows POSIX but most do adhere important principle.

1) BIOS check system and calls first bootloader MBR located on primary HDD
2) First stage bootloader call 2nd bootloader
3) Second stage bootloade called from /boot/
4) Kernel then loads mounts root partitions
5) Kernel hand over to boot process present at /sbin/init
6) /sbin/init loads all services and mount all partitions present at /etc/fstab
7) user login presented

#hosts file
The /etc/hosts file provides a list of IP addresses with corresponding hostnames. This allows you to specify hostnames for an IP address in one place on the local machine, and then have multiple applications connect to external resources via their hostnames. The system of host files precedes DNS, and hosts files are always checked before DNS is queried. As a result, /etc/hosts can be useful for maintaining small “internal” networks, for development purposes, and for managing clusters.

This command is available by default on OS X and Linux machines. You can use it to copy files to a Linode, as well as between remote servers. If you use SSH keys, you can use the scp command without entering a password for every transfer.

#The user file-creation mode mask (umask) is use to determine the file permission for newly created files. It can be used to control the default file permission for new files. It is a four-digit octal number.

umask 0023

Linux us very liberal for permissions. The default permissions for file will be 666 and directories 777

i.e. files rw- rw- rw-
directories rwx rwx rwx

One can find default umask value for user in below files
/etc/profile or
/etc/login.defs

after file creation based on user umask file permissions are derived. screenshot in directory


#list aliases
alias

#Create alias
alias ec="echo 'anand'"

Alias will be added untill the terminal is up and running. 


#to make alias permanant, add it in ~/.bashrc file
nano ~/.bashrc

check for alias section
alias ec="echo 'anand'"

line follows
# some more ls aliases
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias l='ls -CF'
alias ec='echo "Anand"'

to source file use below command
source ~/.bashrc


For Bash, they work as follows. Read down the appropriate column. Executes A, then B, then C, etc. The B1, B2, B3 means it executes only the first of those files found.

#less
for huge text output use less to get output page one at a time
one can move forward and backward

#in case of more it is not possible to move backward

#less command is faster because it does not load the entire file at once and allows navigation though file using page up/down keys.

#seq command
seq 100 > numbers.txt

The preceding command creates a file with the numbers 1 to 100 on separate lines.

#head numbers.txt
head -3 numbers.txt   // will show first 3 lines 

#tail numbers.txt      // will display last 10 lines
