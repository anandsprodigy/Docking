#The Debian based “apt” command stands for (Advanced Package Tool). 
Apt is an advanced package manager for Debian based system (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, etc.), that automatically and
intelligently search, install, update and resolves dependency of packages on Gnu/Linux system from command line.


#The “tar” command is a Tape Archive is useful in creation of archive, in a number of file format and their extraction.

root@tecmint:~# tar -zxvf abc.tar.gz (Remember 'z' for .tar.gz)
root@tecmint:~# tar -jxvf abc.tar.bz2 (Remember 'j' for .tar.bz2)
root@tecmint:~# tar -cvf archieve.tar.gz(.bz2) /path/to/folder/abc
Note: A ‘tar.gz‘ means gzipped. ‘tar.bz2‘ is compressed with bzip which uses a better but slower compression method.

#Run level

A runlevel is one of the modes that a Unix-based, dedicated server or a VPS server OS will run on. Each runlevel has a certain number of services stopped or started, giving the user control over the behavior of the machine. Conventionally, seven runlevels exist, numbered from zero to six.


After the Linux kernel has booted, the init program reads the /etc/inittab file to determine the behavior for each runlevel. 
Unless the user specifies another value as a kernel boot parameter, the system will attempt to enter (start) the default runlevel.

Standard run levels for RedHat based distributions
Run Level	Mode	Action
0	Halt	Shuts down system
1	Single-User Mode	Does not configure network interfaces, start daemons, or allow non-root logins
2	Multi-User Mode	Does not configure network interfaces or start daemons.
3	Multi-User Mode with Networking	Starts the system normally.
4	Undefined	Not used/User-definable
5	X11	As runlevel 3 + display manager(X)
6	Reboot	Reboots the system
