#The Debian based “apt” command stands for (Advanced Package Tool). 
Apt is an advanced package manager for Debian based system (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, etc.), that automatically and
intelligently search, install, update and resolves dependency of packages on Gnu/Linux system from command line.


#The “tar” command is a Tape Archive is useful in creation of archive, in a number of file format and their extraction.

root@tecmint:~# tar -zxvf abc.tar.gz (Remember 'z' for .tar.gz)
root@tecmint:~# tar -jxvf abc.tar.bz2 (Remember 'j' for .tar.bz2)
root@tecmint:~# tar -cvf archieve.tar.gz(.bz2) /path/to/folder/abc
Note: A ‘tar.gz‘ means gzipped. ‘tar.bz2‘ is compressed with bzip which uses a better but slower compression method.
