Process Priorities
When you run a program in Linux, such as the vim editor, the system creates an instance of the program. This running instance of a program is called a process. Every process requires a certain amount of system resources, such as CPU time and RAM, to be able to perform its tasks. Each process is assigned a process priority to determine how much CPU or processor time is allocated to it for execution.

Note that there are hundreds of processes running in a Linux system at any point in time. Sometimes they all get sufficient CPU time for execution and sometimes they don't, which is when the idea of process priority comes in handy. The process priority determines which process gets more CPU time and which processes can be left to wait in the background (for execution at a later time when things are less demanding).

In addition to processes, in Linux, there are users of processes. Linux allows us to set a level of 'niceness' (a nice value) on a per-user basis. Note that the nice value only controls how much CPU time each process is allocated, but not how much memory can be used or which I/O devices can be used. Bear in mind that the process priority may differ from the nice value. The nice value is how much priority the Linux kernel will grant to each named user, whereas the process priority is the actual priority of a running process.

There are 140 possible priorities and two kinds (real-time priority and the nice value).
Real-time priority goes from 1 to 99, with 100 to 139 dedicated to user-space.
The nice value of a process can have a range between -20 (highest priority) to +19 (lowest priority).
If the nice value of a process is lower, it gets a higher priority, which means the CPU will execute that process more often.
If the nice value of a process is higher, it gets a lesser priority, which means the CPU will execute that process less often (whenever it gets an opportunity).
By default, the nice value is zero.
Verifying the Process Priorities
You can verify the process priority or the nice value on the command line. Run the following command to determine the nice value of a process if you know the process ID (PID):

ps -o pid,comm,nice -p 2951

Here is the output of the command showing the process ID (PID), the command associated with that process ID, and the nice value (NI) for that instance:

PID COMMAND NI

2951 bash 0

You can also run the top command to display the list of processes, process IDs, their nice values (NI column), CPU, memory, and other details. Here is a screenshot of the output of the top command:

Modifying Process Priority
You can set and modify the priority of a process to make more efficient use of limited system resources.

Let us consider the scenario where the Linux system has slowed down due to a shortage of RAM. In other words, the programs running on the system (processes) are too slow and some of them are not responding at all. In this case, you have the option of killing some processes in a terminal. However, you might not want to stop those processes completely, and even the terminal by itself could be lagging as a result of one very demanding process consuming all available resources. You can avoid this by starting the lagging process (for instance the 'bash' process) with a higher priority than before.

The nice Command
You can use the nice command to start a process with a specific nice value. For example:

nice -n -5 bash

This command sets the nice value of the bash shell process to -5.

The renice Command
You can use the renice command to modify the priority of a running process. For example:

renice -15 2951

This command changes the priority of the bash shell process to -15. The number 2951 is the process ID (PID) of bash. Here is the output of this command:

2951: old priority -5, new priority -15


#task kill

kill -9 <pid>

#different signals

Signal Name	Signal Number	Description
SIGHUP	1	Hang up detected on controlling terminal or death of controlling process
SIGINT	2	Issued if the user sends an interrupt signal (Ctrl + C)
SIGQUIT	3	Issued if the user sends a quit signal (Ctrl + D)
SIGFPE	8	Issued if an illegal mathematical operation is attempted
SIGKILL	9	If a process gets this signal it must quit immediately and will not perform any clean-up operations
SIGALRM	14	Alarm clock signal (used for timers)
SIGTERM	15	Software termination signal (sent by kill by default)

#ps

#get parent process ID PPID
ps -f 

#get Nice and Priority values along with state
ps -lf

#kill process
kill <PID>

kill -9 <PID>

#kill processes using name 

pkill <process_name>

pkill -9 <process_name>

Default signal used by kill is SIGTERM or 15

#list signals
kill -l

#create backgound process
./script &

command &


sleep 10000 &
[1] 389
sleep: cannot read realtime clock: Invalid argument

#check background jobs
jobs

#jobs in background

read d &
[4] 393

jobs
[1]   Stopped                 read A
[2]   Stopped                 read B
[3]-  Stopped                 read c
[4]+  Stopped                 read d

Here background process provide output PID


The jobs command lists all the processes running in the Terminal, including foreground and background processes. You can clearly see their status as running, suspended, or stopped. The numbers in <> show the job ID. The + sign indicates which command will receive fg and bg commands by default.

#make background process foreground
fg 3

where 3 jobs id if you use only fg then + sign job will get foreground entry

CTRL + Z --> STOP

CTRL + C --> TERMINATE

detailed output for jobs is as follows

jobs -l

#top --> is performace monitoring tool like iostat and vmstat. Out will be as follows
