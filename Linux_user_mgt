#check user login password properties

 sudo chage -l <username>
 
--> Output will be as follows:
 
Last password change                                    : May 27, 2020
Password expires                                        : never

Account expires                                         : never
Minimum number of days between password change          : 0
Maximum number of days between password change          : 99999
Number of days of warning before password expires       : 7

#list all usres for the linux OS

cat /etc/passwd

--> output will be 
anand:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/anand:/bin/bash
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin

There are some system user and groups creaated in order to interact with the system/processes

ABove output will shows information as 
username:password(show disabled):<user_ID>:<group_ID>:GECOS:<user_home_dir>:<user_login_shell>

# If set to MD5 , MD5-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to SHA256, SHA256-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to SHA512, SHA512-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to DES, DES-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password (default)
# Overrides the MD5_CRYPT_ENAB option
#
# Note: It is recommended to use a value consistent with

PASS_MIN_LEN    6
PASS_MAX_LEN    25

We can setup password length, age, encryption, home directory details etc.
