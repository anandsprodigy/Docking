In this command provide password 2 times

Or you can try below steps

sudo echo password | passwd --stdin linda

#list all groups
cat /etc/group

#add users to different group
sudo usermod -aG <group_name> <user_name>
 
Where a flag is to append group. If a flag not used then all secondary groups will be removed.

Primary Group: Primary groups are those whose name is similar with username. These are created by default along with user because linux
user must be part of at least one group.

Secondary groups are manually created groups which are used to assign previleges and permissions.

sudo usermod -aG general_users audrey


#restrict commands to users

1) create restricted shell
cp /bin/bash /bin/rbash
useradd -s /bin/rbash localuser

Add existing user
 usermod -s /bin/rbash localuser
 
 #lock user 
 
 passwd -l anand
 
 #unlock user 
 
 passwd -u anand
 
 #set never expiring passwd
 
 passwd -x -1 anand
 
 
#ulimit
ulimit provides control over the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it, on systems that allow such control.
 
#All Linux limits are categorized as either soft or hard:

Soft limit – All users can change soft limits, up to max set by the hard limits. Pass the -S option to the ulimit.
Hard limit – Only root users allowed to change esource hard limits. Pass the -H option to the ulimit.

ulimit -a 

The syntax is as follows to view all soft and hard limits for the current user:
ulimit -Sa ## Show soft limit ##
ulimit -Ha ## Show hard limit ##
