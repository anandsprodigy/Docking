#telnet port 23 (TCP)
#SSH port 22 (TCP)

Telnet and SSH used to connect to other device or PC. However; telnet is not secure.

One of the greatest disadvantages of this protocol is that all data, including usernames and passwords, is sent in clear text, 
which is a potential security risk. 
This is the main reason why Telnet is rarely used today and is being replaced by a much secure protocol called SSH. 


#Networking Firewall

The firewall
A firewall is a set of rules. When a data packet moves into or out of a protected network space, 
its contents (in particular, information about its origin, target, and the protocol it plans to use) are tested against the firewall rules
to see if it should be allowed through.

#On the one hand, iptables is a tool for managing firewall rules on a Linux machine.

#On the other hand, firewalld is also a tool for managing firewall rules on a Linux machine.

#Ubuntu includes its own firewall, known as ufw – short for “uncomplicated firewall.”
Ufw is an easier-to-use frontend for the standard Linux iptables commands.
