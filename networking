#ping

Ping(Packet Internet Groper)
ping command is used to ensure that a computer can communicate to a specified device over the network. 
ping command sends Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP) Echo Request messages in the form of packets to the destination computer
and waits in order to get the response back. Once the packets are received by the destined computer, it starts sending the packets back. 
This command keeps executing until it si interrupted.

ping command provides details such as

number of packets transmitted
number of packets received
time taken by the packet to return



#telnet port 23 (TCP)
#SSH port 22 (TCP)

Telnet and SSH used to connect to other device or PC. However; telnet is not secure.

One of the greatest disadvantages of this protocol is that all data, including usernames and passwords, is sent in clear text, 
which is a potential security risk. 
This is the main reason why Telnet is rarely used today and is being replaced by a much secure protocol called SSH. 


#Networking Firewall

The firewall
A firewall is a set of rules. When a data packet moves into or out of a protected network space, 
its contents (in particular, information about its origin, target, and the protocol it plans to use) are tested against the firewall rules
to see if it should be allowed through.

#On the one hand, iptables is a tool for managing firewall rules on a Linux machine.

#On the other hand, firewalld is also a tool for managing firewall rules on a Linux machine.

#Ubuntu includes its own firewall, known as ufw – short for “uncomplicated firewall.”
Ufw is an easier-to-use frontend for the standard Linux iptables commands.

#list tables 
iptables -L -n

If it shows error that to update/upgraade kernel then use below commands

https://www.howtogeek.com/177621/the-beginners-guide-to-iptables-the-linux-firewall/

sudo apt-get update --> Only checks for updates
sudo apt-get upgrade --> install updates

apt-get update --> updates the list of available packages and their versions, but it does not install or upgrade any packages.
apt-get upgrade --> actually installs newer versions of the packages you have. After updating the lists, the package manager knows about available updates for the software you have installed.
