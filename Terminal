In the article I will give you a brief overview on the difference between /dev/tty and /dev/pts i.e. tty vs pts in Linux.

 

TTY
terminal = tty = text input/output environment
Teletypewriter originally and now also means any terminal on Linux/Unix systems. It also means any serial port on Unix/Linux systems
A tty is a regular terminal device (the console on your server, for example).
tty consoles are managed by systemd in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 OS.
tty consoles are created on-the-fly upon access.
The allowed number of consoles can be configured in /etc/systemd/logind.conf file.
Set NAutoVTs= value in this file to desired number to have systemd capable of generating those many tty consoles.

# ps aux | grep tty
root     10139  0.0  0.0 116428   916 ttyS0    Ss+  May29   0:00 /sbin/agetty --keep-baud 115200 38400 9600 ttyS0 vt220
root     11598  0.0  0.0 121904  2328 tty1     Ss+  May31   0:02 -bash

This continues upto tty6 i.e. default number of allowed tty consoles are 6
One can switch from tty1 to tty6 using Ctrl+Alt+F[1-6] on the console
Below screenshot is from my HP iLO console where you can view the terminal id


PTS
Stands for pseudo terminal slave.
A pts is the slave part of a pty.
A pty (pseudo terminal device) is a terminal device which is emulated by an other program (example: xterm, screen, or ssh are such programs).
/dev/pts contains entries corresponding to devices. /dev/pts is a special directory that is created dynamically by the Linux kernel. The contents of the directory vary with time and reflect the state of the running system.
The entries in /dev/pts correspond to pseudo-terminals (or pseudo-TTYs, or PTYs).


In laymen terms the primary difference between TTY and PTS is the type of connection to the computer. TTY ports are direct connections to the computer such as a keyboard/mouse or a serial connection to the device. PTS connections are SSH connections or telnet connections. All of these connections can connect to a shell which will allow you to issue commands to the computer.
