File System in Linux

File system is logical collection of files on partition or disk

It is normal to have n=more than 1 partitions

#partition naming

/dev/xxyN

dev is name of the directory where all device files presents
xx is type of the device on which partition is present hd is for IDE disks and sd is for SCSI disks
y device on which partition is present
N denotes partiotion 1-4 (Primary) >5 (logical)

#inode
An inode is a data structure that stores various information about a file in Linux, such as the access mode (read, write, execute permissions), ownership, file type, file size, group, number of links, etc. Each inode is identified by an integer number. An inode is assigned to a file when it is created.

Some file systems (most notably ext3) create all inodes when the file system is created. This means that it is possible to run out of storage because all of the inodes are used, although there is available space on the disk. Other file systems (like xfs) create inodes as needed.

#get inode counts

#There are 3 kind of "timestamps":

Access - the last time the file was read
Modify - the last time the file was modified (content has been modified)
Change - the last time meta data of the file was changed (e.g. permissions)
